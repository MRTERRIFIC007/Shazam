For Google Sign-In on iOS, ensure your `Info.plist` contains the correct URL scheme:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Editor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

## üì± Usage

1. **Sign In**: Create an account or sign in with Google
2. **Recognize Songs**: Tap the main button to start listening
3. **View Results**: See song details including artist, album, and cover art
4. **History**: Access your previously identified songs
5. **Profile**: Manage your account settings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### iOS Google Sign-In Issues

If you encounter errors with Google Sign-In on iOS, verify:

- Your `GoogleService-Info.plist` contains the correct CLIENT_ID
- Your `Info.plist` URL schemes match the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- App Check is properly configured in Firebase
- You're using the correct bundle ID for your app

## üîí Privacy

This app requires microphone permissions to recognize songs. All audio processing is handled securely, and no audio recordings are stored.
